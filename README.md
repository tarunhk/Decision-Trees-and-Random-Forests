# 🌳 Decision Trees & 🌲 Random Forest 

## 📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** models for classification.

The models are trained on a Heart Disease dataset to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on medical features.

This task helps in understanding tree-based models, ensemble learning, and feature importance.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this task is to:

- Train a Decision Tree Classifier  
- Control overfitting using tree depth  
- Train a Random Forest Classifier  
- Compare model accuracy  
- Analyze feature importance  
- Evaluate model performance  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn

## ▶️ How to Run the Program

### Step 1: Install required libraries
```bash
pip3 install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```
### Step 2: Run the script

Open terminal inside the project folder and run:
```bash
python3 tree_model.py
```

## ⚙️ What the Program Does

The script performs the following steps:

- Loads the Heart Disease dataset
- Splits data into training and testing sets
- Trains a Decision Tree model
- Trains a Random Forest model
- Compares accuracy of both models
- Displays feature importance graph
